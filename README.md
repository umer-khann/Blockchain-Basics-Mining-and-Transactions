# Blockchain Fundamentals: Mining and Ethereum Testnet Transactions

This repository documents a hands-on blockchain assignment focused on
understanding basic blockchain concepts, wallet interactions, and Ethereum
testnet transactions.

---

## 1. Block Mining

- Mined the **genesis block** and subsequent transaction blocks
- Observed block structure including:
  - Block hash
  - Previous hash
  - Merkle root
  - Nonce
  - Transaction count
- Verified mined blocks using the built-in block search functionality

---

## 2. MetaMask Wallet Setup

- Created a MetaMask account
- Explored wallet features such as sending, receiving, and transaction history

---

## 3. Ethereum Sepolia Test Network

- Connected MetaMask to the **Sepolia testnet**
- Obtained test ETH using an Ethereum Sepolia faucet
- Verified wallet balance after funding

---

## 4. Ethereum Transaction Execution

- Sent **0.00780 Sepolia ETH** from Account 1 to Account 2
- Observed balance updates after transaction confirmation
- Reviewed transaction status, gas fee, and hash

---

## 5. Transaction Verification

- Verified the transaction on a blockchain explorer
- Confirmed:
  - Transaction hash
  - Sender and receiver addresses
  - Gas usage
  - Confirmation status

---

## Tools Used
- MetaMask
- Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- Blockchain Explorer
